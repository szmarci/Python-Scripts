# Shell History

Know what commands I've run in the last few days.

Currently the script just spits out raw commands from last week, along with their date.

## Todo

* Better Output

* Filter by command
  * `if command.startswith(input)` or `if input in command` ?

* Remove extraneous aliases?
* Or read in a list of aliases and then expand them
