# What to watch?

I have a whole lot of unwatched movies, and deciding what to watch is not an easy thing to do.

Let's automate!

# Usage

Copy the sample config file: `cp config.py.example config.py`

Add folder paths in the PATHS list.

Run `python watch.py`

# Todo

This can seriously become a movie database 'tagger' like Picard - all it needs is a sleek GUI.

Errors can be handled by using searching rather than the top result, it'll require some human intervention though.

We might need to get back to the omdb package if we need to add searching etc back.
